Just test the current source with:

> mkdir myBuild
> cd myBuild
> cmake .. (TO SPECIFY THE INSTALLATION DIRECTORY TO BE THE CURRENT DIRECTORY)
> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="../myInstallation" .. (TO INSTALL IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTORY)
> make
> make VERBOSE=1 (TO SEE ALL STEPS PRINTED TO SCREEN)
> make install (NOT POSSIBLE AT THAT STAGE, CHECK IN THE BUILD DIRECTORY FOR EXECUTABLES)
> ./Tutorial 45
